            <li>“Impropriety is the soul of wit.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>

 <li>“As lovers, the difference between men and women is that women can love all day long, but men only at times.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

 “When a woman loves you she's not satisfied until she possesses your soul. Because she's weak, she has a rage for domination, and nothing less will satisfy her.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>
<p>

“It is one of the defects of my character that I cannot altogether dislike anyone who makes me laugh.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

“I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. They are strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>

“Women are constantly trying to commit suicide for love, but generally they take care not to succeed.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

“Each one of us is alone in the world. He is shut in a tower of brass, and can communicate with his fellows only by signs, and the signs have no common value, so that their sense is vague and uncertain. We seek pitifully to convey to others the treasures of our heart, but they have not the power to accept them, and so we go lonely, side by side but not together, unable to know our fellows and unknown by them. We are like people living in a country whose language they know so little that, with all manner of beautiful and profound things to say, they are condemned to the banalities of the conversation manual. Their brain is seething with ideas, and they can only tell you that the umbrella of the gardener's aunt is in the house.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>
<p>
<li>

“There is no cruelty greater than a woman's to a man who loves her and whom she does not love; she has no kindness then, no tolerance even, she has only an insane irritation.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>

“Beauty is something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul. And when he has made it, it is not given to all to know it. To recognize it you must repeat the adventure of the artist. It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>

“Sometimes people carry to such perfection the mask they have assumed that in due course they actually become the person they seem.”

“The world is hard and cruel. We are here none knows why, and we go none knows whither. We must be very humble. We must see the beauty of quietness. We must go through life so inconspicuously that Fate does not notice us. And let us seek the love of simple, ignorant people. Their ignorance is better than all our knowledge. Let us be silent, content in our little corner, meek and gentle like them. That is the wisdom of life.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

“She loved three things — a joke, a
glass of wine, and a handsome man.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

“Life isn't long enough for love and art.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“For men, as a rule, love is but an episode which takes place among the other affairs of the day, and the emphasis laid on it in novels gives it an importance which is untrue to life. There are few men to whom it is the most important thing in the world, and they are not the very interesting ones; even women, with whom the subject is of paramount interest, have a contempt for them.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>

<li>
“It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>

<li>
“A woman can forgive a man for the harm he does her...but she can never forgive him for the sacrifices he makes on her account.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“I could have forgiven it if he'd fallen desperately in love with someone and gone off with her. I should have thought that natural. I shouldn't really have blamed him. I should have thought he was led away. Men are so weak, and women are so unscrupulous.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“People talk of beauty lightly, and having no feeling for words, they use that one carelessly, so that it loses its force; and the thing it stands for, sharing its name with a hundred trivial objects, is deprived of dignity. They call beautiful a dress, a dog, a sermon; and when they are face to face with Beauty cannot recognise it.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“I think I was a little disappointed in her. I expected then people to be more of a piece than I do now, and I was distressed to find so much vindictiveness in so charming a creature. I did not realize how motley are the qualities that go to make up a human being. Now I am well aware that pettiness and grandeur, malice and charity, hatred and love, can find place side by side in the same human heart.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

“The writer is more concerned to know than to judge.”

“Unconsciously, perhaps, we treasure the power we have over people by their regard for our opinion of them, and we hate those upon whom we have no such influence.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence

“Women are strange little beasts,' he said to Dr. Coutras. 'You can treat them like dogs, you can beat them till your arm aches, and still they love you.' He shrugged his shoulders. 'Of course, it is one of the most absurd illusions of Christianity that they have souls.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“I forget who it was that recommended men for their soul's good to do each day two things they disliked: it was a wise man, and it is a precept that I have followed scrupulously; for every day I have got up and I have gone to bed.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“Because women can do nothing except love, they've given it a ridiculous importance. They want to persuade us that it's the whole of life. It's an insignificant part.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>
<p>

“I did not believe him capable of love. That is an emotion in which tenderness is an essential part, but Strickland had no tenderness either for himself or for others; there is in love a sense of weakness, a desire to protect, an eagerness to do good and to give pleasure--if not unselfishness, at all events a selfishness which marvellously conceals itself; it has in it a certain diffidence.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>

“To my mind the most interesting thing in art is the 
personality of the artist; and if that is singular, I am 
willing to excuse a thousand faults.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“Man's desire for the approval of his fellows is so strong, his dread of their censure so violent, that he himself has brought his enemy (conscience) within his gates; and it keeps watch over him, vigilant always in the interests of its master to crush any half-formed desire to break away from the herd.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“It was a night so beautiful that your soul seemed hardly able to bear the prison of the body.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon and Sixpence
</li></p>
<p>
<li>
“With the superciliousness of extreme youth, I put thirty-five as the utmost limit at which a man might fall in love without making a fool of himself.” 
― W. Somerset Maugham, The Moon And Sixpence
