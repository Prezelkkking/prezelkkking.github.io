                    <h2> Family Background </h2>
                    <p> Capitaine Kaye was born in April 14, 1998. Her hometown is a historical city situated in southern China, Yangzhou. Both her parents are businessman and they are running a small but busy company in China. She is the only child in her family so at her birth she has been able to do whatever she wants in her little family. Maybe that is why she has always been blamed as "too naughty to be a girl". Anyway, she is treasured by her tolerant family. No one except herself knows where she is right know because she is travelling around the world by herself, volunteering, taking photos and enjoying her life. If you want to know where she is, well, Africa again, I guess, that is the continent she would always like to go during her childhood.</p>
                    <h2> Personality </h2>
                    <p>She is obviously not a captain of a boat or master of a sea as she barely knows how to swim. But she likes people to call her that. That's a fairly cool name and she always wants to be a cool person. You can call her Madam K, detective K, superwoman K, magician K or whatever cool things with her name at the end. Somehow she is a daydreamer but she is trying her best to be a better person. People around her say that she is a really self-motivated and mentally strong girl. "The joy of the people" is her title. She likes to bring people warmth and happiness so she has travelled to a lot of places for volunteering. What is important about her, or what she shares with most people is that she does have her own dream.</p>
                    <h2> Abilities </h2>
                    <p>She graduated with diplomat in journalism and French from the University of Hogwarts. She has learned Korean, German, and Italian by herself, which also rendered her an unforgettable working and volunteering experiences in those countries.Basically, she has a gift in languages with her ability to speak fluently in Chinese, English, French, German, Italian and Korean. At the same time, she has won several awards for best photographer of the year as she started her career in photojournalism and took picture of the whole world. Singing, piano, guitar and Ukelele are her favourite leisure. She is also a nice cook and good gameplayer (Legue of legends are the best). </p>
